# Synechocystis growth fit

In this repositiry you find a notebook to recreate the plots from the publication.

Use 'n_Data' to adjust the amount of data points to simulate (this can lead to long ciputing times)

You can adjust the style of the plots.
It's also possible to change parameter values to inspect the effect on the simulations after fitting.

If you want to save the plots, change 'savefigs' to 'True'. Define the image format at img_type.
